# Boggle Game
Boggle is a popular game. The game is played using a grid of lettered dice, in which players attempt to find words in sequences of adjacent letters.

Refreshing the page or click Button 'Restart Game' will randomly generate a Board that each die is displayed in a random position in the grid, and also with a random face to be facing upside.

**following this rule:
Gameplay involves clicking on dice one by one to build up a word. You can only click on dice that are adjacent to your last selected die and that are not already selected.
Those dices that can be selected are highlighted in bold orange borders.
